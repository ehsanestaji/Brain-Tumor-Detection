# Brain Scan Image Classification Project

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation for classifying brain scan images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project includes sample image visualization, image preprocessing, and model training using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and a sequential CNN.

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Image Display

Visual inspection of our dataset is crucial before we dive into the model building. The following function `display_sample_images` provides a quick glance at the images we will be processing.

```python
# Here would be the Python code for display_sample_images function
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Image Preprocessing

To prepare our images for input into our model, we carry out a series of preprocessing steps. These include grayscaling, resizing, normalizing, and blurring the images. The `preprocess_images` function encapsulates all these tasks.

```python
# Here would be the Python code for preprocess_images function
```

## üèãÔ∏è Model Training

We use a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier as our baseline model, followed by a more complex CNN for improved performance.

### k-NN Model Visualization

```python
# Here would be the Python code to train and visualize k-NN classification
```

### CNN Architecture

```python
# Here would be the Python code that defines the CNN architecture
```

**Model Summary:**

```
# Here would be the text output of the model summary
```

<div id="model-evaluation"></div>

## üîç Model Evaluation

Post-training, we evaluate our model using a set of test images that have been through the same preprocessing pipeline.

### Classification Report

```python
# Here would be the Python code to generate the classification report
```
